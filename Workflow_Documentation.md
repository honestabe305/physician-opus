## Renewal Workflow System

### Purpose
The Renewal Workflow System is the core automated process that manages license, DEA registration, and CSR license renewals for physicians. It ensures no credentials expire unnoticed and provides structured guidance through the renewal process.

### Workflow Logic

#### 1. Workflow Initiation
```
Trigger: Automatic (every 6 hours) or Manual
Condition: Credentials expiring within 90 days
Process:
├── Scan all physicians (220+ physicians, 770+ credentials)
├── Check expiration dates for licenses, DEA registrations, CSR licenses
├── Create renewal workflows for qualifying credentials
└── Generate initial checklists and timelines
```

#### 2. Workflow States
```
Lifecycle: not_started → in_progress → filed → under_review → approved/rejected/expired

not_started:
├── Initial state when workflow is created
├── Next Action: "Begin renewal application"
├── Due Date: 90 days before expiration
└── Progress: 0%

in_progress:
├── Application has been started
├── Next Action: "Complete renewal application"
├── Application Date: Set to current date
└── Progress: Varies based on checklist completion

filed:
├── Application submitted to state board
├── Next Action: "Await state board review"
├── Filed Date: Set to submission date
└── Progress: 75%

under_review:
├── State board is reviewing application
├── Next Action: "Respond to any board inquiries"
├── Timeline: Estimated 7 days after filing
└── Progress: 90%

approved:
├── Renewal successfully completed
├── Next Action: None
├── Approval Date: Set to approval date
└── Progress: 100%

rejected:
├── Renewal application was rejected
├── Next Action: "Review rejection and resubmit"
├── Rejection Date: Set to rejection date
└── Includes rejection reason

expired:
├── License expired before renewal completion
├── Next Action: "License has expired - immediate action required"

2. Check for existing active workflows
3. Validate checklist JSON structure
4. Review foreign key constraints
```

**2. Checklist Generation Errors**
```
Symptoms: Empty or malformed checklists
Cause: Missing entity type or physician data
Solution:
├── Verify entity type is 'license', 'dea', or 'csr'
├── Check physician exists and has valid role
├── Ensure state-specific requirements are available
└── Validate checklist JSON structure

Debug Steps:
1. Log entity type and physician ID
2. Check generateRenewalChecklist function
3. Verify state-specific logic
4. Review due date calculations
```

**3. Status Update Failures**
```
Symptoms: Workflow status doesn't update
Cause: Invalid status transitions or missing workflow
Solution:
