Core data model (CAQH-aligned)

Organization (Group)

Legal/DBA name, Tax ID (EIN), Group NPI

Incorporation details (state, date, entity type)

Mailing + physical address

Banking artifacts: IRS CP-575/147C, W-9, bank letter (file uploads + versioning)

Group officials (name, role, contact)

Practice locations (see UI requirements below) and count of linked providers per location

Provider

Demographics/PII: full name, aliases, DOB, SSN (secure), contact info, citizenship, languages, gender

Provider types & practice settings (enum: MD/DO/PA/NP/etc.; telemedicine/clinic/hospital, etc.)

Primary state + additional states

Identifiers: Individual NPI, taxonomy code(s) (multi) with authoritative lookup and search

Professional IDs

State licenses (multi-state): number, state, status, issue/exp dates, class, board/agency, documents

DEA: number, schedules, registered address, exp date, document

State Controlled Substance (CDS/SDSI) where applicable: number, state, exp date, document

ECFMG (required if IMG), USMLE (optional/rare), ECFMG/USMLE docs

Medicare/Medicaid provider numbers not here (store per-payer enrollment below)

Education & Training

Medical school, internship, residency(ies), fellowship(s)

Month + Year (no day) for start/end

Specialty at each program + affiliated university hospital

Diploma/cert uploads

Work history (last 5 years)

Month/Year start–end, employer, role, location

Gap explanations with attachment support

Hospital admitting privileges / arrangements

Hospital, privilege type, status, effective/expiration, contact, letter upload

Liability insurance

Carrier name, policy #, effective/expiration, limits, certificate upload

External accounts (restricted)

CAQH ProView ID (tokenized access if you integrate later)

Do not store PECOS/NPPES logins; capture consent + policy acknowledgement instead

Practice locations (Medallion-style, not radio-list)

Locations displayed as expandable cards/rows with:

Full address fields: street 1/2, ZIP+4, city, county, state, phone, fax

Hours, place type (clinic, telemed hub), notes

Validation: USPS autocomplete, ZIP+4 and county auto-lookup

Provider ↔ location linking UI (must link before payer enrollment to satisfy “apply per location per state” logic).

Payer enrollment module (front-page usability fixes)

Payer list grid per provider (and group roll-up) with:

Payer name, practice location (spelled out, not just a link), lines of business (HMO/PPO/Medicare Advantage/etc.)

Provider ID, PAR status, effective date, re-credentialing/revalidation date

Status bar (blue → in process, green → approved, red → stopped/denied) with timestamped stage changes

Inline icons to indicate “proof of enrollment uploaded”, “portal update pending”, “data incomplete”

Quick filters: status, location, payer, line of business, due in next 30/60/90 days

Enrollment record detail

Fields: practice location, line(s) of business, network, TIN/NPI used, provider ID, PAR status, effective date, revalidation/re-cred date, contacts

Uploads: approval letter, welcome letter, screenshots, ticket/confirmation numbers

Notes with timeline & @mentions; show latest 1–2 notes on the list row (no deep-dive required)

Stateful workflow

Stages: Discovery → Data Complete → Submitted → Payer Processing → Approved → Active (or Stopped/Denied with reason)

Auto-advance rules: when Provider ID + Effective Date saved or “proof of enrollment” uploaded → mark Approved/Active with date stamp

“Stopped” requires reason + date; display stopped date on the row (as in transcript)

Multi-state Medicare handling

Allow multiple Medicare enrollments per provider across states with unique IDs/effective dates

Navigation & UX

Dual navigation (as shown): left-hand jump menu for major sections + top tabs for scope-specific views

Top tabs: Overview | Provider Data | IDs | Education/Training | Work History | Privileges | Liability | Payers | Documents | Audit

Section jump links on each page

Month/Year date pickers everywhere dates don’t need days (education, work history)

“Quick snapshot” surfaces on payer list (ID/effective/re-cred date on the row; no digging into notes)

Provider and group dashboards

Cards: Group NPI, EIN, # Practices, # Providers

“What’s due soon” (re-credentialing, license/DEA/CDS expirations, malpractice renewal)

“What moved” (recent approvals, submissions, stops)

Documents & evidence (group + provider)

Central document repository with types, tags (year, payer, location), versioning

Show historical artifacts per group (W-9s, bank letters, IRS, approval letters) and per provider (licenses, ECFMG, etc.)

Evidence linking: documents can be attached to enrollment, license, privilege, education, or group level

Bulk upload + drag-to-relate to entities; duplicate detection

Reporting & analytics (replace the “reports that suck”)

Operational

Re-credentialing calendar/report (by payer, location, provider; next 30/60/90 days)

Enrollment pipeline & cycle time (by payer, location, state; stage durations; SLA trends)

License/DEA/CDS expiration matrix with auto reminders

Work history completeness, gap explanations missing

Hospital privileges and malpractice coverage completeness

Throughput charts

New enrollments per month; approvals per month; average days from “Data Complete” → “Approved”

“Aging by status” bar chart

Exports & subscriptions

CSV/XLSX exports with saved filters

Email/PDF scheduled reports for clients

Drill-through

From charts to filtered tables (e.g., click “aging >60 days” to see those enrollments)

Data quality & validation

ZIP+4 + county enforcement on practice addresses

Required fields per section with contextual requirements (e.g., ECFMG required if foreign grad)

Duplicate detection (provider by NPI, license by state+number, enrollment by payer+location)

Field masks (policy #, DEA), date logic (end ≥ start), status reason requirements

“Medicare/Medicaid numbers belong to payer enrollment records, not Professional IDs”

Compliance, roles & audit

Role-based access control (RBA): restrict External Accounts and sensitive PII

Consent/attestation records for accessing third-party portals; do not store PECOS/NPPES credentials

Full audit trail: who changed what/when (status, IDs, dates, uploads)

Encrypted storage for sensitive fields; download watermarking; access logs

Automations & integrations (now + future)

Lookups

NPI Registry + taxonomy auto-suggest

USPS/Smarty for address + ZIP+4 + county

Reminders

License/DEA/CDS/privilege/liability renewals

Re-credentialing/revalidation dates per payer

Portal sync (where possible)

Optional light ingestion/scraping/API for commercial payers (timestamp updates); exclude Medicare (as noted: highly protected)

CAQH import assist

Read-only pull or guided import (CSV/PDF capture) to prefill provider profile

Form filler (commercial first)

Map canonical fields → payer forms; evidence packet builder (W-9, license, CV, malpractice, etc.)

Admin & configuration

Enumerations: provider types, practice settings, lines of business, status reasons

Payer directory (names, lines of business, required fields, re-credentialing cadence)

Location templates (per-state default fields)

SLA targets per stage for cycle-time reporting
