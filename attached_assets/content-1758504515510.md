# Agent 3 by Replit

### The most autonomous Agent for building production-ready Apps

### Build & refine your app with Agent

Start by telling the Replit Agent what kind of app or site you want to build. Then, keep improving it by giving the Agent feedback. Agent automatically searches the Web as needed to ensure it has access to the latest information to fulfill your request

For more complex tasks, turn on advanced options like **Extended Thinking and High-Power Models**.

### Easily import designs from tools like Figma and perfect them with Visual Editor

Import your designs from design tools like Figma and then refine them using our Visual Editor by simply selecting elements in your app’s preview for editing

![add database example](https://cdn.replit.com/sanity/blog/database.png)

### Integrate securely with built-in services like Database and Auth, plus third-party tools

Easily connect with our in-built Database and User authentication or third-party services like Stripe, Open AI and more — your keys stay secure and your integrations stay seamless.

### Agent tests its own work so you dont have to

**Agent tests and fixes its code**, constantly improving your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop. While building your app, Agent will now periodically test it using a browser, generating a report and fixing the issues it finds. Our proprietary testing system is **3x faster and 10x more cost effective** than Computer Use Models.

![Agent Generation](https://cdn.replit.com/sanity/blog/homepage_grid_image_05.png)

### Build Agents & Automations

Agent can **build other agents and create workflows**. That means you can automate complex and repetitive workflows using natural language to increase your efficiency and productivity. You can interact with the agent you built by integrating it with your apps like Slack or email.

# The safest place for vibe coding

Vibe coding makes software creation accessible to everyone, entirely through natural language. Whether it’s personal software for yourself and family, a new business coming to life, or internal tools at your workplace, Replit is the best place for anybody to build.

### Private deployments to protect innovations

Share and test internal prototypes securely. Ensure only authorized team members can access your projects before they're ready for the world.

### Role-based access control

Easily map your identity framework and assign specific roles to individuals or groups. Manage invites with SCIM. Control who can view, edit, or deploy your applications.

## Don't just take our word for it

I asked Replit to “clone LinkedIn” — just to see how far it would get with a single prompt. The result? A surprisingly functional prototype. It’s a powerful reminder: with the right framing, today’s AI tools can turn a single idea into working software.\\

If I went to my developer and said, make this, it would probably take him a week of his time. I did it in an hour or two.\\

I can honestly say that if it weren't for Replit and that prototype that I was able to build in two weeks, it just wouldn't have happened.\\

The opportunity would have perished. Someone else would have done it first...\\

Replit for us was the way to actually do it. And it actually completely and utterly changed the trajectory of our company in a massive way.\\
